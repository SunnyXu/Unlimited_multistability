# Unlimited_multistability
This code is to repeat the Figure 2 in the paper "Unlimited multistability in multisite phosphorylation systems (https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08102). The simulation was performed using Spyder for Tellurium 3.7 (http://tellurium.analogmachine.org/). Please note that certain intitial conditions are necessary in order to repeat the exact results in the Figure 2b. This work has been submitted to BioModels (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/) and published on the its website (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2002110001#Overview).
