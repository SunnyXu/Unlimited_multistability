# Unlimited_multistability
This code is to repeat the Figure 2 in the paper "Unlimited multistability in multisite phosphorylation systems (https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08102). The simulation was performed using Spyder for Tellurium 3.7 (http://tellurium.analogmachine.org/). Please note that certain intitial conditions are necessary in order to repeat the exact results in the Figure 2b. This work has been submitted to BioModels (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/). If you use any of the codes, please cite the article (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.15.585236), the model (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2002110001#Overview), and the GitHub website (https://github.com/SunnyXu/Unlimited_multistability).
