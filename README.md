# Unlimited_multistability
This code is to repeat the Figure 2 in the paper "Unlimited multistability in multisite phosphorylation systems (https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08102). The simulation was performed using Spyder for Tellurium 3.7. Please note that certain intitial conditions are necessary in order to repeat the exact results in the Figure 2b.
