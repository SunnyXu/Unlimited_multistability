# Unlimited_multistability
This code is to repeat the Figure 2 in the paper "Unlimited multistability in multisite phosphorylation systems (https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08102). The simulation was performed using Spyder for Tellurium 3.7 (http://tellurium.analogmachine.org/). Please note that certain intitial conditions are necessary in order to repeat the exact results in the paper. And Errors from numerical simulations may do exist.
